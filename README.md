# My First Coding Assignment
![](its%20fine.jpg)
## About Me
I am located in San Diego, CA. I graduated from the University of Florida in April of 2021 with a BA in visual arts, a minor in art history, and a certificate in graphic design. Since then, I have been pursuing my master's degree in mass communications specializing in public relations, as well as a graduate certificate in web design.

Although I previously worked at the University of Florida, I recently started a new job at California State University San Marcos as a digital communications coordinator. My personal interests include fencing, weightlifting, photography, going to the beach, and reading.
## Past Coding Experience
Absolutely none. Please help. I am so confused.
## Career Goals
To do public relations at the corporate level.
